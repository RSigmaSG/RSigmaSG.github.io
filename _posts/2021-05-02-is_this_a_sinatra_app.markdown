For my ffinal project of Sinatra section, I decided to do something for a hobby I have been wanting to get into for a while, Cosplaying. I decided to go with an application that would let the user create multiple cosplay objects and collect materials to amke them around the web. The user is able to add materials and the app gives the user a final cost for making the cosplay. The app can also be seen by a user who is not logged in. Anyone is able to see what characters are being cosplayed from what show and made by whome but ofcourse for security purposes, is only able to see tthe main feed. 

The idea of the feed is to keep open the possibility of making it a more social platform where users can posty cosplay progresses and finals. For now my app is just designed for the user to assemble cosplays. Overall making this app was a prettty fun experience and I added some css to tie things together a bit more neatly.
