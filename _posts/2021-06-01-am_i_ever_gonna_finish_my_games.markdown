I made this project to be able to track your game backlogs. User''s can play sessions of games and update their thoughts on posts to share on this website. I struggled quite a bit on the planning stage of this project as I did not have a clear idea as to how to approach this or structure this.

In the end I ended up making quite a few mockups and scrapping them till I came up to the structure of play sessions to be able to continue. I used an already availible game library API for the user to start their games and then complete it once done putting down final thoughts.
